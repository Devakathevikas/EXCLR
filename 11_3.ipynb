But then, I discovered the magic of meal prepping!  And the result? These vibrant beauties!\n> \n> The picture shows two glass containers, each overflowing with a delicious-looking teriyaki chicken and veggie bowl. Fluffy white rice forms the base, topped with tender chunks of chicken, vibrant orange and red bell peppers, and healthy florets of broccoli. It's a balanced and colourful meal that shouts \"healthy and delicious!\"\n> \n> \n> My meal prep journey hasn't been without its bumps. Initially, it felt overwhelming – the chopping, the cooking, the portioning... It was a lot!  I started small, focusing on just one or two meals at a time.  I found that prepping on a Sunday afternoon, while listening to a podcast, made the process much more enjoyable. Gradually, I experimented with different recipes, finding combinations I loved and could easily replicate.\n> \n> \n> Now, meal prepping isn't just about convenience; it's about intentionality.  It allows me to control exactly what I eat, ensuring I get enough vegetables, protein, and healthy carbs.  Plus, having these colourful containers ready to go in the fridge motivates me to make healthier choices throughout the week.  It’s a win-win for my taste buds and my waistline!\n> \n> So, if you're thinking about starting your own meal prep journey, my advice is: start small, be patient with yourself, and most importantly, have fun experimenting with flavours!  You might just surprise yourself with how much you enjoy it – and the delicious results!\n"
